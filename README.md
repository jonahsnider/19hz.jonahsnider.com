# 19hz.jonahsnider.com

I live in the bay area and like staying active in the local rave scene (really into experimental bass music & jungle right now).
[19hz.info](https://19hz.info) is the most complete listing of bay area music events, but doesn't have any way to get notifications when new events are added.
This app gives me an RSS feed of the events on 19hz.info which I can plug into something like Zapier to let me know whenever a new event pops up.

## Usage

The website is available at [19hz.jonahsnider.com](https://19hz.jonahsnider.com).

You can access the feed for a region by visiting `https://19hz.jonahsnider.com/api/region/{region}/feed.xml`, where `{region}` is the region code used by 19hz.info.

For example, the link for the bay area region (`BayArea` region code) is [19hz.jonahsnider.com/api/region/BayArea/feed.xml](https://19hz.jonahsnider.com/api/region/BayArea/feed.xml).
